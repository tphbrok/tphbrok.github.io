<i>Beatrec</i> is an open source minimalistic rolling sampler, recording either a
single beat or whatever range is set to loop in the DAW (assuming the DAW correctly
passes this information on to the plug-in).

# List of features

- Displays the last recording and allows exporting it (in 16-bit stereo WAV format)
- Overwrites the last recording <i>after</i> the recording range has elapsed (so no more half-overwritten recordings when stopping a loop)

# Download

<Alert>
  Since I'm only scraping the surface of audio plug-in development with{" "}
  <i>Beatrec</i>, I can not (yet) guarantee that this plug-in and future
  versions will not break your projects or crash your DAW. Hopefully I'll gather
  enough experience in the future to be able to guarantee a stable piece of
  software, but not for now. Nevertheless, I highly doubt anything bad happening
  to your system. Therefore, the plug-in, its design and its internal workings
  are highly likely to change. If you do decide to download and use the plug-in,
  use it with a 'beta testing' mindset.
  <br />
  <b>Conclusion: use the plug-in at your own risk!</b>

# Installation instructions

Download the plug-in in the desired format, and move the downloaded file to whatever folder the DAW looks in to find plug-ins. In my case (macOS), that will be `/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/CLAP` or `/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3`.

# Source code

# Acknowledgements

I'd like express my gratitude to [Robbert van der Helm](https://github.com/robbert-vdh) for developing [`nih-plug`](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug), a Rust-based audio plug-in development framework. I have a lot of experience in music production, and some experience in signal processing and system-level languages like C and C++, but Rust and audio plug-in development were pretty much brand new for me. Luckily, `nih-plug` made this a breeze!
